# Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging with NLTK
This Python program performs Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging on a given sentence using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). POS tagging is the process of assigning grammatical tags (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence.

## Overview
The program utilizes NLTK to tokenize the input sentence into words and then applies POS tagging using NLTK's built-in POS tagger. The resulting output displays each word in the sentence along with its corresponding POS tag.
