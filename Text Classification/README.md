# Text Classification with Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Python script demonstrating text classification using the 20 Newsgroups dataset and Logistic Regression. The goal is to predict the category (or topic) of a news article based on its content.

## What is Topic Classification?
Topic classification, also known as text classification or document categorization, is a natural language processing (NLP) task where text documents are categorized into predefined classes or topics. It involves training a machine learning model to assign the most appropriate category label to a given piece of text.

## Dataset
The 20 Newsgroups dataset used in this project is a popular benchmark dataset in NLP. It consists of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents across 20 different categories (topics), including politics, technology, sports, and more. The dataset is commonly used for tasks like text classification and clustering.
