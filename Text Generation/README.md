# Text Generation with GPT-2
This repository contains a Python script demonstrating text generation using the GPT-2 language model from the transformers library by Hugging Face. The script allows users to provide a prompt or starting phrase, and GPT-2 generates text based on this input.

## Overview
Text generation is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where a model generates coherent text based on given input. In this project, we leverage the power of GPT-2, a state-of-the-art language model, to demonstrate text generation capabilities.
